## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed

## 0.1.7
* Reset current first character entered (triggered with backspace)
* Status bar updates with current first character entered
* Working spec tests
* No known bugs

## 1.3.0
* Adds new homing beacon feature with setting to disable.
* Adds some missing spec tests.

## 1.3.1
* Fixes shift-enter (backward search) on find and replace's mini pane.

## 1.4.0
* Jumpy now clears irrelevant labels after the firs character is
  entered.  This helps home in on your target.

## 1.4.1
* Added some very useful instructions about how to bind 'f' to
  jumpy:toggle.  This of course replaces native 'f' functionality.

## 1.5.0
* Jumpy now works with code folding and soft wraps (word wraps).
* NOTE: vim-mode seems to have very unexpected behavior with toggles and
  word wraps (even with Jumpy disabled).  Better behavior in insert mode!
* Although there are a few more features in the pipeline planned.
  This completes the last of the known unexpected behavior (bugs).
